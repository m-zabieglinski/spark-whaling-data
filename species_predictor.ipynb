    "### About\n",
    "Majority of whales spotted by American offshore whalers between 1820 and 1860 was of species stated as \"whale\". This likely meant a baleen whale, as opposed to a toothed whale such as a dolphin or a killer whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains development of a ML model that attempts to label these baleen whales of unknown species, based on the very limited data of whales with their species identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source data\n",
    "American Offshore Whaling Logbook - obtained from https://whalinghistory.org/av/logs/ in October 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment and method\n",
    "ML tools available in Spark using Scala - on notebook running an Almond kernel.\n"
